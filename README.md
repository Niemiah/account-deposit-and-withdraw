# Account-Deposit-and-Withdraw
Able to take in deposits and withdraws, if the withdraw amount is more than what's in the account it will say "Withdrawal amount exceeded account balance" and won't let
you take it out.
Created the class file Account.java to initialize the double instance variable, constructor and methods.
Created the class file AccountTest.java with the import java.util.Scanner to get the input and output of floating-point numbers with Account.java objects.
